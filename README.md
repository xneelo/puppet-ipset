## Overview

This module manages Linux IP sets.

* Checks for current ipset state, before doing any changes to it.
* Applies ipset every time it drifts from target state,
  not only on config file change.
* Handles type changes.
* Autostart support for RHEL 6 and RHEL 7 family (upstart, systemd).

## Usage

### Array

IP sets can be filled from an array data structure.
Typically passed from Hiera.

```puppet
ipset { 'foo':
  ensure => present,
  set    => ['1.2.3.4', '5.6.7.8'],
  type   => 'hash:ip',
}
```

### String

You can also pass a pre-formatted string directly, using one entry per line
(with ``\n`` as a separator).
This pattern is practical when generating the IP set entries using a template.

```puppet
ipset { 'foo':
  ensure => present,
  set    => "1.2.3.4\n5.6.7.8",
  type   => 'hash:ip',
}
```

### Module file

IP sets content can also be stored in a module file:

```puppet
ipset { 'foo':
  ensure => present,
  set    => "puppet:///modules/${module_name}/foo.ipset",
}
```

### Local file

Or using a plain text file stored on the filesystem:

```puppet
file { '/tmp/bar_set_content':
  ensure  => present,
  content => "1.2.3.0/24\n5.6.7.8/32"
}
-> ipset { 'bar':
  ensure => present,
  set    => 'file:///tmp/bar_set_content',
  type   => 'hash:net',
}
```

## Reference

The module uses puppet-strings for documentation. The result is the
[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) file.

## Limitations

* Tested on Debian and RedHat-like Linux distributions
* Only **hash** ipsets are supported (this excludes *bitmap* and *list:set*)
